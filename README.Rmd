The goal of metalearners is to provide a dataset that arose from a set of experiments intended to benchmark the time-to-fit and predictive performance of a number of alternative model stacking methods (or "meta-learners") for use in the stacks package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of metalearners like so:

``` r
pak::pak("simonpcouch/metalearners")
```

## Data

The dataset in the metalearners package looks like this:

```{r example}

metalearners
```
